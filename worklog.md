- Added NEXTAUTH_SECRET to .env
- Created SessionProvider wrapper component
- Updated layout.tsx to wrap app in SessionProvider
- Built LoginPage component with dark+green glassmorphism UI (stadium background, email/password inputs, show/hide toggle, validation, error states, Google login button, link to signup)
- Built SignupPage component with dark+green glassmorphism UI (name/email/password/confirm inputs, password strength checks, terms checkbox, validation, auto-login after signup, link to login)
- Generated AI stadium background image at /public/stadium-bg.png
- Created AuthGate component that shows Login/Signup if not authenticated, loading spinner while checking session
- Integrated AuthGate into Home component's main layout return
- Updated Header to show user's actual name/email from session, added user dropdown menu with logout

Stage Summary:

- Signup page with password strength indicator, auto-login after registration
- Route protection: unauthenticated users only see Login/Signup pages
- Session persistence via JWT (30-day expiry)
- Logout from Settings page and Header dropdown menu
- All UI matches dark+green Sportix theme with glassmorphism
- Zero lint errors
